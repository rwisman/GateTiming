						(above 10K Ohms) when the gate is open.</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Open <i>GateTiming</i>. Close switches and illuminate photoresistors.</li>
							<li><i>Setup</i> will check: 1) circuit connected to the

					<p><b>Use</b></p>
					<blockquote>
						<ol>
							<li>Gates are normally closed, opened when an object 
							enters the gate. When illuminated, photoresistors 
							typically have a lower resistance; when blocked the 
							resistance gradually increases to some maximum. The gate must be open/closed for a 
							minimum of about 0.001s to be measured, placing a 
							constrain on the size and velocity of the object 
							(i.e. 2 cm object blocks the gate twice the time of a 
							1 cm object moving at the same velocity). Results 
							can be improved by using a larger object.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
							<li>Automatic calibration adjusts for local lighting 
							by adjusting the volume up to a maximum until a 
							sufficiently strong signal indicates all the gates 
							are closed, that volume level is then used to 
							determine when gates are open or closed during 
							timing. A lower volume setting indicates a stronger 
							signal, a calibrated volume of 50% is very good and 
							generally produces more accurate time measures than 
							a higher volume. Calibrating at a lower volume power 
							level generally implies that the light source is 
							relatively bright. Recommend shrouding 
							photoresistors to reduce ambient light.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
							<li>Detection of each gate is performed, requiring 
							that an object enter and exit each gate for 
							comparison with gate low (enter gate) and high (exit 
							gate) values during 
							timing measurements. A Good rating indicates the light reaching the photoresistors is 
							blocked by the object, receiving low levels of 
							ambient illumination. A Poor rating with strong 
							illumination may indicate the object blocked the 
							photoresistor near the limit of it's operating 
							response time.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
							<li>Timing accuracy when using photoresistors is 
							limited by two main controllable variables: the 
							local lighting conditions and the detection level 
							setting. Generally, the lighting should maximally 
							illuminate the photoresistors when the gate is 
							closed (no object blocking gate) and minimally when gate is open 
							(object blocking gate); automatic 
							calibration attempts to adjust the volume to 
							correspond to that maximum. Additionally, the user 
							can manually adjust the detection level that defines 
							the level a gate is determined to be open or closed; 
							for example, shadows can indicate the gate opens, 
							triggering a spurious timing event - adjusting the 
							detection level lower would lower the level a gate 
							was determined to be open. Generally, the problem 
							can be solved by increasing the illumination and/or 
							using a larger object to block the photoresistor. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
							<li>Photo resistors often have a latency of about 
							0.01s limiting the accuracy of time measurements.&nbsp; 
							However, if photoresistors with similar latency are 
							used as gates, the time between gates should be 
							relatively accurate.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
							<li>Red lasers, such as used in visual pointers, can 
							serve as a focused light source, generally producing 
							superior results to flashlights, etc. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
							<li>Only complete timing runs are recorded, incomplete 
							runs are automatically deleted. The app has no way of knowing 
							which gates have been entered, only that the number 
							of gates specified for a run have been entered, four 
							gates entered one time or one gate entered four 
							times appear the same.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
							<li>Complete runs can be deleted from the list by 
							selecting (touching) the run; the runs following the 
							deleted run are renumbered.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
							<li>Simple listings can be sorted by selecting Time &#8597; 
							or Run &#8597;, each toggles between ascending and 
							descending sorts. During timing, new runs are added 
							to the end of the list; sorting occurs only when 
							starting a new set of timings or when timings are 
							listed, not when timings are collected due to the 
							significant overhead of sorting while timings are in 
							progress.</li>

	<p><b>Design </b></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>The app generates an 4410 Hz sine wave as the input signal to the circuit, 
		the gates of the circuit modify the 
		signal which is the circuit's output to the microphone input, the signal 
		from the microphone input is examined by the <i>GateTiming</i> app. When photoresistors 
		illumination increases the amplitude of the signal received by the 
		microphone increases. The amplitude of the 
		microphone input can then be measured for transitions from low-to-high amplitude 
		indicating a closing (i.e. an object exits the gate) or high-to-low indicating a gate opening 
		(i.e. an object enters the gate). </p>
		<p>Calibration and gate detection are performed one time when the app 
		opens, necessary to adjust for the lighting conditions at each gate 
		before accurate timing measurements can be done. Calibration and gate detection work together to determine what 
		signal value 
		from the circuit indicates when gate is entered or exited; the greater 
		the signal difference between entering and exiting a gate, the more 
		accurate the timing measurement. To calibrate, the app reads the circuit 
		output signal, cranking up the volume in small steps to increase the 
		amplitude until the detected signal amplitude is near 
		the maximum possible, M; the lower the value (e.g. illumination), the higher the 
		volume must be increased. After calibration sets the volume, gate detection finds the lowest amplitude 
		for all the 
		gates when each gate is blocked (entered) in turn, L is the maximum of 
		the lows. Finding the 
		maximum low signal when gates are blocked is necessary because photoresistors 
		increase resistance as illumination decreases but are never completely 
		open or closed, also one photoresistor can be illuminated differently 
		than another. The maximum M and minimum L then set the upper and lower 
		limits of the signal. The threshold amplitude, TA, level used to determine when an 
		object enters or exits a gate is: TA=(M+L)/2; (M+L)/2 is the amplitude 
		midpoint between M and L. An amplitude changing from above to below the 
		threshold is defined as LOW (gate entered), changing from below to above 
		the threshold is defined as HIGH (gate exited), the threshold is then 
		used during timing.</p>

	<p><b>Accuracy</b></p>
						<blockquote>
							<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
								<tr>
									<td>Accuracy of measurement is highly dependent upon 
							the lighting conditions; using red lasers as light sources and 
							shielding the photoresistors from ambient light can 
							improve accuracy. To test the accuracy using $1 LED 
									flashlights for illumination and shrouded photoresistors, a free falling 
									object (rectangular block) was 
									dropped (by hand) from height of 1/2 meter. 
									The predicted time is given by t = 
									sqrt(1/2m*2/9.81m/s) = 0.319s, eight measured 
									times and mean are in the table below. 
									<p>The variation of measurements from 
									predicted was primarily due to differences in 
							the height where dropped above the first gate. For 
							example, dropping from 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) above the first gate 
							produced a timing of 0.310s on run 1, the time 
							was less than predicted because the block was traveling a little 
							faster through the gates (about 0.5 mph or 0.804672 kph at the first 
							gate). Other timing variations are likely due to 
							slight changes to the block's profile relative to the 
							gates, not always maintaining a stable orientation.</p>
									<p>Below images present the detailed timing results 
									of entry, exit and elapsed times, simple 
									results of entry time only, and the 
							amplitude graph of a 0.309s timing. The graph marks 
							the time when the first gate was blocked at 6.002s 
							and the second gate was blocked at 6.313s, the

							calibration and gate detection determines the amplitude threshold the 
							gates are considered blocked, in this case at 66% of 
							maximum amplitude measuring a time interval between 
									entering the two gates of 0.309s.</p>

						<b>WARNING: Volume control</b></p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>Do not listen to a headset or speaker connected 
							to the device while using <i>GateTiming</i> as a 
							potentially damaging noise is output through the 
							speakers. </p>
							<p>In order to calibrate with the circuit and lighting 
							condition variations, <i>GateTiming</i> adjusts the 
							media volume (commonly ranging on a 1 to 15 scale) 
							until the signal received through the circuit is 
							near maximum amplitude. On most Android devices 
							tested with several LED white light sources 
							(flashlight and desk lamp) pointed at the 
							photoresistor, 80% of the maximum signal amplitude 
							was achieved at 60-75% of the maximum volume. 
							However, some Android tablets and phones limit the 
							speaker volume to protect the device and user 
							hearing but also limits the signal amplitude which 
							can cause calibration to fail. On some devices, the 
							volume limit can be adjusted by the user. For 
							example, Samsung provides instructions for changing 
							the volume limit at:
							<a href="http://support-us.samsung.com/cyber/popup/iframe/pop_troubleshooting_fr.jsp?from_osc=&homeid=29220&idx=675562&modelcode=SM-G930TZKATMB&modelname=SM-G930T&">

						</blockquote>
						<p>
						<b>Limitations</b></p>
						<blockquote>
							<p><i>Accuracy</i> of timing is limited by the audio headset. 
							The peak amplitude of a 4410 Hz sine wave 
							signal is examined to determine when it reaches a 
							threshold for entering (amplitude changing from high 
							to low) or exiting (amplitude changing from low to 
							high). The 4410 Hz has peaks every 0.00022s; 
							accuracy can be no better but can be much worse 
							dependent upon gate latency, lighting conditions, 
							even the shape and size of the object to be timed or 
							the angle it passes through a gate. </p>
							<p><i>Timings</i> are limited to 5000 total (e.g. 
							500 runs through 10 gates), when 
							limit reached the app stops timing at the last 
							complete run, the user can then save the current 
							timings as a CVS file, delete current times and 
							resume timing.</p>
							<p>Number of photoresistor gates in a circuit are 
							limited by the total circuit resistance when all 
							photoresistors are fully illuminated (closed). 
							Because the photoresistors are serially connected, 
							the total circuit resistance is the sum of all 
							photoresistor resistance. An upper resistance limit 
							for the circuit varies depending upon the audio 
							output volume level of the device. A device with high 
							volume and a circuit of 2000&#937;, could work well while 
							the same circuit would fail on a lower volume 
							device. </p>
							<p>Finally, some devices are faster and have better 
							audio than others. A Nexus 7 produced the falling 
							object results above with a very symmetric audio 
							signal and consistent timings. A $100 phone recorded 
							a very asymmetric audio signal and failed to record 
							a single complete timing run correctly; the same 
							phone was successful when the photoresistor's 
							illumination was blocked for a longer period of time 
							by a slower moving object.</p>
